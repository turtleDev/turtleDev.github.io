# Hello!

I'm **turtleDev**, a self-proclaimed practioner of the mystic arts.

My dream was to become a computer programmer, but it turns out, it wasn't that hard to accomplish. So I'm on the hunt for my next dream :). I like reinventing the wheel, creating things for no other reason than just because I can.
