# Hello, Traveller!

I'm **turtleDev**, a self-proclaimed practitioner of the mystic arts.

My dream was to become a computer programmer, but it turns out, it wasn't that hard to accomplish. So I'm on the hunt for my next dream :). I like reinventing the wheel, creating things for no other reason than just because I can. I'm inspired by GNU/Linux and it's ecosystem of projects and one day hope to become a regular contributor to it.

When I'm not writing code, I like to read Manga & Books; occasionally I'll indulge in a Novel or two. I also love to play computer games, and game exclusively on Linux to help support the Linux Gaming ecosystem. 

This here is my little corner of the Internet, a place where I can put my thoughts down, and maybe help out someone along the way. I feel that knowledge is the most important thing that one can pass down, and this is my attempt to build an archive of my life experiences and discoveries.

Here be dragons ... and turtles!
